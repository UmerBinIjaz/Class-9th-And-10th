### 📌 Message to Students

In our last class, we covered **JavaScript Variables and Data Types**. Building on this foundation, we will now move forward with **advanced JavaScript concepts** to develop a strong practical understanding.

After completing JavaScript, our goal is to **create a full-fledged website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, giving you valuable hands-on experience—especially beneficial for **ICS students**.

Once the course is completed, we will revise all topics, solve **programming challenges**, and strengthen your **problem-solving skills**, with full guidance and support throughout the process.
